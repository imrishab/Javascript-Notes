String Opertions :


how to declare a string : 

two meathods to do so:

1. const name = "Rishabh"
output : Rishabh



2. const name = new string("Rishabh")
output : [String: 'Rishabh']
note : string is stored in form of object here


In String, the data is stored as key value pair, that means :

here, in the above example i have stored "Rishabh" as my string so : 

R is stored at [0] position
i is stored at [1] position
s is stored at [2] position
h is stored at [3] position
a is stored at [4] position
b is stored at [5] position
h is stored at [6] position

I can access them by : 

const name = "Rishabh"
console.log(name[1])
output : i

or 

const name = new String("Rishabh")
console.log(name[3])
output : h


note : We will use new and most preffered syntax including backticks `` and ${}
